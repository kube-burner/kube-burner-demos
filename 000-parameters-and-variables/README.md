## Running basic kube-burner tests

Some relevant variables in this example are:

- name: Defines the job name, commonly used to tag the metrics generated by kube-burner and to label the namespaces and objects created.
- namespace: Namespace prefix used to create namespaces.
- jobIterations: Number of job iterations.
- qps/burst: Controls the API request rate.
- namespacedIterations: Whether or not create a new namespace per job iteration.
- waitWhenFinished: When enabled, kube-burner waits for all pods/jobs (builds in OpenShift too) to be running/complete before finishing the job. A pod is considered running its pod status condition is Ready.
- preLoadImages: Pre load all container images in the nodes.

Run these commands

```shell
kube-burner init -c config.yml --uuid=demo

# Listing all created namespaces
kubectl get ns -l kube-burner-job=kube-burner-demo
kubectl get ns -l kube-burner-uuid=demo
# Listing all deployments within a namespace
kubectl get deploy -n kube-burner-demo-0
# Listing all deployments using a label selector
kubectl get deploy -A -l kube-burner-job=kube-burner-demo

# Manually destroy created stuff
kube-burner destroy --uuid=demo

# Set gc to true and re-run
kube-burner init -c config.yml
```

Demonstrate that all namespaces were garbage collected at the end of the run

```shell
kubectl get ns | grep kube-burner-demo
```
